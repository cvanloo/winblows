# Winblows

For those poor souls, whose workplace still forces them to use W$nblows.

## Clearly not meant for programmers

Microsoft clearly doesn't want a programmer to use their OS.
That's why they include even single-handed Dvorak variants, but of course,
only the glorious Programmer's Dvorak is missing.

How to fix:

```powershell
./dvorak_please.ps1
```

(If you don't need an IME, just skip that installation step when prompted.)

## Ignorant as always

Who would possibly ever want to use an IME with any other layout but QWERTY?
I can't imagine either...

How to fix:

```powershell
./dvorak_please.ps1
```

...if you want to use Programmer's Dvorak, or:

```powershell
./ime_you_ignorant_swine.ps1
# in the prompt select the correct layout
# (default value is your default (number 1) layout
```

...to choose from one of your installed layouts.
